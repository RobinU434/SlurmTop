  A terminal UI for monitoring Slurm HPC jobs — like <code>htop</code> for your cluster.
</p>

SlurmTop gives you a live overview of your running and past jobs, lets you read
stdout/stderr logs, inspect resource usage, monitor CPU and GPU activity on compute
nodes, cancel or resubmit jobs, and more — all from a single terminal.

```

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+ and access to Slurm CLI tools (`squeue`, `sacct`, `scontrol`).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/slurmtop.git
cd slurmtop

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e .

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

You can also install the repository directly from remote via: 

```bash
# Install via pip into local python environment
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/RobinU434/SlurmTop.git
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run on a cluster login node
slurmtop

# Run from your local machine, monitoring a remote cluster
slurmtop --remote user@login.hpc.edu

# Customize refresh rate and time window
slurmtop --refresh 3 --days 14

# Disable auto-refresh (manual refresh only with 'r')
slurmtop --refresh off
```

## Layout

SlurmTop has a four-panel layout:

| Panel | Position | Content |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Active Jobs** | Top-left | Running and pending jobs from `squeue` |
| **Terminated Jobs** | Bottom-left | Completed, failed, timed-out, and cancelled jobs from `sacct` |
| **Job Details** | Top-right (2/3) | Tabbed view: stdout, stderr, live CPU, live GPU, resource stats |
| **Job Metadata** | Middle-right | Tabbed view: Resources, Submission info, Raw scontrol output |
| **Command Log** | Bottom-right | Timestamped log of actions and responses |

A **cluster overview bar** at the top shows your running/pending counts and partition
availability.

## Key Bindings

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up` / `Down` | Navigate job list (wraps between Active and Terminated). The selected job's details update immediately. |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Switch focus between right-side panels |
| `Left` / `Right` | Switch focus between right-side panels |
| `[` / `]` | Switch tabs in the **Job Details** panel (stdout, stderr, cpu, gpu, stats) |
| `(` / `)` | Switch tabs in the **Job Metadata** panel (Resources, Submission, Raw) |
| `Escape` | Close search bar |

### Actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Open search bar — filter jobs by ID, name, or partition. Press `Escape` to close and clear |
| `m` | Bookmark / unbookmark the selected job. Bookmarked jobs show a ★ prefix and are pinned to the top of their table |
| `c` | Cancel the selected job (with confirmation prompt) |
| `Shift+C` | **Force cancel** — sends SIGKILL immediately, no confirmation |
| `s` | Resubmit a terminated job using its original sbatch script (with confirmation) |
| `e` | Open the job's **stdout** log in an external editor (suspends TUI) |
| `Shift+E` | Open the job's **stderr** log in an external editor |
| `o` | SSH to the selected job's compute node. Suspends the TUI; type `exit` to return |
| `r` | Force refresh all job data |
| `?` | Toggle the help screen (also closes with `Escape`) |
| `q` | Quit |

## Detail Tabs

Select a job in either table (Up/Down) and use `[` / `]` to switch between these tabs:

### stdout / stderr

Displays the tail of the job's standard output and error log files. SlurmTop finds log
files by reading `StdOut` / `StdErr` from `scontrol show job`. For older jobs no longer
in Slurm's memory, it checks the **log path cache** first (see
[Log Path Cache](#log-path-cache)), then falls back to searching the working directory
for common patterns (`slurm-JOBID.out`, `JOBNAME-JOBID.out`, `logs/` subdirectory, etc).

### cpu

Live process listing from the job's compute node, similar to `top`. Shows PID, %CPU,
%MEM, RSS, VSZ, elapsed time, and command name. Auto-refreshes while the tab is active.

### gpu

Live `nvidia-smi` output showing **only the GPUs allocated to the selected job**. Uses
`srun --overlap --jobid` to run nvidia-smi inside the job's cgroup, so GPU visibility
is automatically restricted to the job's allocation. The header shows
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for confirmation. Auto-refreshes while the tab is active.

### stats

Accounting statistics from `sstat` (running jobs) and `sacct`:

- **CPU** — average CPU time, total CPU, frequency, wall time
- **Memory** — requested, max/average RSS, max/average VM size, peak node/task
- **GPU** — allocated GPU count and type from TRES
- **Disk I/O** — average and max read/write

## Metadata Tabs

Use `(` / `)` to switch between these tabs:

### Resources

Partition, node count, CPUs, memory, GPU/GRES allocation, TRES, time limit, runtime,
account, and QoS.

### Submission

Submit time, start/end times, working directory, stdout/stderr paths, and the original
submit command.

### Raw

All key-value pairs from `scontrol show job` or `sacct`, displayed verbatim.

## Visual Features

### Column Width Limits

Job names and partition names are truncated to 16 characters by default (with `…` when
truncated). This keeps the tables compact. Configure via `config.toml`:

```toml
max_name_width = 20       # wider name column
max_partition_width = 10  # narrower partition column
```

Set to `0` for unlimited width.

### State Abbreviations

For compact displays, enable abbreviated state names in the Terminated Jobs table:

```toml
abbreviate_states = true
```

| Full State | Abbreviation |
|------------|-------------|
| COMPLETED | COMP |
| FAILED | FAIL |
| TIMEOUT | TIME |
| CANCELLED | CAN |
| OUT_OF_MEMORY | OOM |
| NODE_FAIL | NFAIL |
| PREEMPTED | PREEMPT |

### Color-Coded Partitions

Each partition is assigned a consistent color across both job tables. Colors are
deterministic (based on the partition name) so they stay stable across sessions. You can
override colors in the config file (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### Color-Coded Job States

**Active Jobs** (Job ID column):

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| RUNNING | Green |
| PENDING | Yellow |
| COMPLETING | Orange |
| SUSPENDED, REQUEUED | Dim |

**Terminated Jobs** (State column):

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| COMPLETED | Green |
| FAILED, OUT_OF_MEMORY, NODE_FAIL | Red |
| TIMEOUT | Yellow |
| CANCELLED | Dim grey |
| PREEMPTED | Dim yellow |

### Cluster Overview Bar

The top line shows a summary of your jobs and cluster partitions:

```
mot824  5 running  2 pending    gpu:10/5/1/16  cpu:42/58/0/100
```

Partition format is `name:A/I/O/T`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **A** | Allocated — nodes currently running jobs |
| **I** | Idle — nodes available for new jobs |
| **O** | Other — nodes that are down, drained, or in maintenance |
| **T** | Total — total nodes in the partition |

### Bookmarks

Press `m` to bookmark any job. Bookmarked jobs are pinned to the top of their table with
a ★ prefix. Bookmarks persist for the duration of the session.

### Open Logs in Editor

Press `e` to open the selected job's stdout log in an external text editor, or
`Shift+E` for stderr. The TUI suspends while the editor is open and resumes when you
close it.

The default editor is `vim`. To change it, set `editor` in your config file:

```toml
editor = "nano"    # or "vim", "less", "code", etc.
```

In **remote mode**, the log file is first copied to a local temp file via `scp`, opened
in the editor, and cleaned up when the editor closes.

If the configured editor is not found on your system, an error is shown in the Command
Log (e.g., `editor 'code' not found — set 'editor' in config.toml`).

### Job Completion Notifications

When a running job finishes (completes, fails, times out, etc.), SlurmTop:
- Rings the terminal bell
- Attempts a desktop notification via `notify-send` (Linux)
- Logs the event in the Command Log panel

### Command Log

The bottom-right panel shows a timestamped log of all actions and their results:

```
14:23:05 refresh
  >>> complete
14:23:12 scancel 2465400
  >>> Job 2465400 cancelled.
14:23:30 ssh galvani-cn109
  >>> session to galvani-cn109 closed
14:24:01 job completed
  >>> 2465485 COMPLETED
```

## Log Path Cache

Slurm's `scontrol show job` provides the exact `StdOut`/`StdErr` file paths for a job,
but only while the job is still in Slurm's memory (typically a few minutes to hours after
completion). After that, the paths are lost and SlurmTop has to guess based on filename
patterns — which can fail if you use custom `--output`/`--error` names.

To solve this, SlurmTop **caches log paths while jobs are still running**, so they remain
available after the job terminates. The cache is stored in
`~/.config/slurmtop/log_cache.json` and is automatically pruned on startup.

### How the cache is populated

There are two modes, chosen automatically:

| Mode | When | How |
|------|------|-----|
| **Background thread** | No daemon running | SlurmTop starts a thread that polls `scontrol` every 30s for all running jobs and caches their log paths. The thread stops when SlurmTop exits. |
| **External daemon** | Daemon is running | SlurmTop detects the daemon via PID file and lets it handle caching. The daemon runs independently and keeps caching even when SlurmTop is closed. |

The active mode is shown in the Command Log at startup.

### Standalone daemon

The daemon caches log paths continuously in the background, even when SlurmTop isn't
open. This is useful if you want to be able to read logs of jobs that finished while you
were away.

```bash
# Start the daemon (runs in foreground, Ctrl+C to stop)
slurmtop-daemon start

# Start in background
slurmtop-daemon start &

# With remote mode
slurmtop-daemon start --remote user@login.hpc.edu &

# Custom poll interval (default: 30s)
slurmtop-daemon start --interval 60

# Check if daemon is running
slurmtop-daemon status

# Stop the daemon
slurmtop-daemon stop
```

When the daemon is running, SlurmTop detects it automatically and skips starting its own
caching thread. When the daemon is stopped, SlurmTop falls back to the built-in thread.

### Cache files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/slurmtop/log_cache.json` | Cached `StdOut`/`StdErr` paths per job ID |
| `~/.config/slurmtop/daemon.pid` | PID file for daemon coordination |

Entries older than 30 days (or `--days`, whichever is larger) are pruned automatically.

## Remote Mode

Run SlurmTop on your local machine while monitoring a remote cluster:

```bash
slurmtop --remote user@login.hpc.edu
```

All Slurm commands (`squeue`, `sacct`, `scontrol`, `sstat`, `scancel`, `sbatch`) are
transparently tunneled via SSH. Log files are read remotely. The GPU tab uses
`srun --overlap` on the remote cluster. The SSH-to-node feature (`o`) connects through
the login node via ProxyJump.

When using `--remote user@host`, the username is automatically used as the default
`--user` for Slurm queries (no need to specify both).

**Login node warning**: If the local or remote hostname contains "login", SlurmTop shows
a warning popup reminding you to be mindful of resource usage on shared login nodes.

For best performance, configure SSH connection multiplexing in `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host login.hpc.edu
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
    ControlPersist 600
```

## Configuration

SlurmTop stores persistent settings in `~/.config/slurmtop/config.toml` (respects
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). The file is created automatically when you use `--partition-order`,
or you can create it by hand.

### Example config file

```toml
# All CLI arguments can be set here as defaults.
# CLI arguments always override config file values.
# When a CLI arg overrides a config value, it is shown in the Command Log.

refresh = 3.0            # -r/--refresh: auto-refresh interval in seconds (0 = off)
days = 14                # -d/--days: how many days back for terminated jobs
user = "myuser"          # -u/--user: Slurm user to monitor
partition = ""           # -p/--partition: filter by partition (empty = all)
no_gpu = false           # --no-gpu: disable GPU monitoring tab
no_live = false          # --no-live: disable live CPU/GPU monitoring
remote = ""              # -H/--remote: SSH target for remote mode
editor = "vim"           # text editor for viewing logs ("vim", "nano", "less", etc.)

# Column display settings
max_name_width = 16      # max characters for job name column (0 = unlimited)
max_partition_width = 16 # max characters for partition column (0 = unlimited)
abbreviate_states = false # use short state names: DONE, FAIL, TIME, CAN, OOM, ...

# Partition display order in the cluster bar.
# Partitions not listed appear after these in their default order.
# Set via CLI: slurmtop --partition-order gpu,cpu,fat
partition_order = ["gpu", "cpu", "fat"]

# Custom partition colors in the job tables.
# Overrides the automatic hash-based coloring.
# Valid color names: cyan, magenta, yellow, green, blue, red,
# bright_cyan, bright_magenta, bright_green, white, dim, bold,
# or any Rich color (e.g. "dark_orange", "grey50").
[partition_colors]
gpu = "green"
cpu = "cyan"
fat = "magenta"
debug = "dim"
```

### CLI vs config file

All CLI arguments can be set in the config file. The precedence is:

**CLI argument > config file > built-in default**

When a CLI argument overrides a config file value that differs, the override is logged in
the Command Log panel at startup.

### Partition order

To set a custom partition order for the cluster bar:

```bash
# Set once — automatically saved for future sessions
slurmtop --partition-order gpu,cpu,fat
```
